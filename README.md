# ICU Bed Allocation Optimization Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive ICU Bed Allocation Optimization Dashboard to improve bed utilization, reduce patient length of stay, and optimize resource allocation in Intensive Care Units.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Business Question

How can we leverage real-time data visualization to enhance ICU bed allocation efficiency and improve patient outcomes?

## Key Features

- Real-time visibility into ICU bed occupancy and availability
- Patient flow and bottleneck identification
- Length-of-stay trend analysis across patient categories and disease groups
- Resource utilization and cost tracking
- Actionable insights for healthcare administrators and clinicians

## Data Sources

The dashboard utilizes rich patient-level data, including:

- Patient demographics (age, sex, race)
- Clinical indicators (blood pressure, white blood cell count, heart rate, respiratory rate)
- Disease and severity metrics
- Resource utilization metrics
- Patient outcomes

## Visualization Solutions

The dashboard incorporates various advanced visualization techniques:

- Stacked area charts for bed occupancy
- Sankey diagrams for patient flow
- Box plots and scatter plots for length of stay analysis
- Treemaps and heat maps for resource utilization insights
- Parallel coordinates plots for clinical indicators

## Expected Business Impact

- Optimize pricing strategies to enhance revenue and market share
- Target specific customer segments with tailored promotions
- Improve decision-making regarding pricing and discounts
- Strengthen customer retention and acquisition
- Enhance competitive positioning in the healthy food market
